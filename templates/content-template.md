## Theoretical Foundations

### [Section 1 Title]

[Detailed explanation of core concept 1. Include:
- Definitions of key terms
- Theoretical background
- Mathematical formulations (using KaTeX where applicable)
- Diagrams (using Mermaid)
- Real-world applications]

**Mathematical Formulation** (Example):

The transformation matrix $T$ is defined as:

$$
T = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $R$ is the rotation matrix and $t$ is the translation vector.

**Diagram** (Example):

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Node A] -->|publishes| B[Topic]
    B -->|subscribes| C[Node B]
```
