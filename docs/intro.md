# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** course — a comprehensive textbook designed to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and embodied robotic systems.

## What You'll Learn

This course takes you on a journey from fundamental robotics concepts to cutting-edge AI integration for humanoid robots. Whether you're a student, researcher, or robotics enthusiast, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- **ROS 2 Architecture** - Master distributed robotic systems
- **Python-AI Integration** - Connect intelligent agents to robot controllers
- **URDF Modeling** - Design humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- **Digital Twin Simulation** - Build realistic virtual environments
- **AI-Robot Brain** - Implement vision-language-action models for embodied AI

## Course Structure

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Master the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), including:
- Communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Python integration with rclpy
- URDF modeling for humanoid robots
- Package management and build systems

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Coming Soon)
Build virtual replicas of physical robots using:
- Gazebo physics simulation
- Unity visualization
- Sensor modeling and integration

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (Coming Soon)
Integrate advanced AI with robotics:
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Vision-language-action (VLA) models
- Embodied AI techniques

### Module 4: Advanced Topics (Coming Soon)
Explore cutting-edge robotics research and applications.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:

- **Programming**: Python 3.10+ (required), C++ familiarity (helpful)
- **Math**: Linear algebra, basic calculus, rigid body transformations
- **System**: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 recommended for ROS 2 development
- **Mindset**: Curiosity and willingness to experiment!

## How to Use This Book

Each module is designed for independent learning with:

- **Learning Objectives** - Clear, measurable outcomes for each chapter
- **Theoretical Foundations** - Rigorous mathematical and conceptual explanations
- **Hands-On Tutorials** - Step-by-step implementation guides
- **Code Examples** - Tested, executable examples with ROS 2 Humble
- **Exercises** - Progressive challenges from beginner to advanced
- **Further Reading** - Curated resources for deeper exploration

All code examples are tested in Docker containers to ensure reproducibility. You can run them in your own ROS 2 environment or use our provided Docker setup.
