    Note over C,R: Asynchronous Goal-Oriented Pattern

    C->>AS: Send Goal: navigate_to_pose<br/>{x: 5.0, y: 3.0, theta: 0.0}
    AS->>C: Goal Accepted<br/>(goal_id: abc123)

    activate AS
    Note over AS,R: Begin execution

    loop Every 200ms (Feedback)
        AS->>R: Get current pose
        R-->>AS: {x: 1.2, y: 0.8, theta: 0.1}
        AS->>C: Feedback: {current_pose: (1.2, 0.8),<br/>distance_remaining: 4.1m}
    end

    alt Goal Succeeded
        AS->>R: Reached target pose
        AS->>C: Result: {success: true,<br/>final_error: 0.02m}
        deactivate AS
    else Goal Canceled
        Note over C: User requests cancellation
        C->>AS: Cancel Goal (abc123)
        AS->>R: Stop motion
        AS->>C: Result: {success: false,<br/>status: CANCELED,<br/>distance_remaining: 2.3m}
        deactivate AS
    else Goal Aborted
        AS->>R: Obstacle detected
        Note over AS: Cannot proceed safely
        AS->>C: Result: {success: false,<br/>status: ABORTED,<br/>reason: "Obstacle blocking path"}
        deactivate AS
    end

**Figure**: Action communication pattern showing goal-oriented behavior with feedback. The client sends a goal asynchronously, receives periodic feedback updates, and eventually gets a final result. Actions support cancellation and provide detailed status information throughout execution.
