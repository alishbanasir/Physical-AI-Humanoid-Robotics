# Chapter 3: Simulating Sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs)

## Overview

Sensor simulation is critical for testing perception and navigation algorithms before deploying to real hardware. This chapter teaches you how to simulate robotic sensorsincluding LiDAR scanners, depth cameras, and inertial measurement units (IMUs)in both Gazebo and Unity environments. You'll learn the theoretical foundations of each sensor type, configure realistic noise models and sensor parameters, visualize sensor data using ROS 2 tools like RViz, and process the simulated data with perception algorithms. By mastering sensor simulation techniques, you can develop and validate complete perception pipelines in safe, controlled virtual environments, dramatically accelerating your robotics development workflow and reducing dependency on expensive physical hardware during the prototyping phase.

**Coming Soon**: Tutorials on Gazebo sensor plugins (GPU ray, depth camera, IMU), Unity Perception package, sensor noise modeling, ROS 2 message visualization, and multi-sensor fusion examples.
