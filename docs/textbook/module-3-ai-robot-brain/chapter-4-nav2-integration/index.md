# Chapter 4: Humanoid Navigation and Motion Planning (Nav2 Integration)

## Overview

Chapter 4 integrates NVIDIA Isaac technologies with ROS 2 Nav2 to achieve autonomous humanoid navigation. Students will learn to configure the Nav2 stack for bipedal robots, set up costmaps from Isaac ROS perception, implement global path planning and local trajectory control (DWB/TEB), and demonstrate navigation achieving >80% goal-reach success. This chapter serves as the capstone, combining Isaac Sim environments, Isaac ROS perception, and optionally RL locomotion policies.

**Prerequisites**: Completion of Chapters 1-3, Nav2 basics, NVIDIA RTX GPU

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

## Coming Soon

The detailed content for this chapter is currently under development and will include:

- **Nav2 Architecture**: Components (planners, controllers, costmaps, behavior trees) and humanoid-specific challenges
- **Installation & Configuration**: Nav2 setup with parameter files for bipedal robots
- **Costmap Construction**: Integrating Isaac ROS VSLAM/LiDAR with Nav2 costmap layers
- **Global Path Planning**: NavFn and Smac Planner for collision-free paths
- **Local Trajectory Control**: DWB controller tuned for humanoid kinematics
- **Behavior Tree Orchestration**: Custom recovery behaviors and multi-goal navigation
- **Humanoid Navigation Challenges**: Balance, footstep planning, narrow corridors, stairs
- **RL Policy Integration**: Using Chapter 3 policies as low-level controllers
- **10+ Integration Examples**: Launch files, configs, and RViz visualizations
- **Module 3 Summary**: Complete recap with Module 4 preview
- **Hands-on Exercises**: From basic navigation to advanced multi-floor scenarios
