# Chapter 2: Hardware-Accelerated Perception (Isaac ROS, VSLAM)

## Overview

Chapter 2 covers GPU-accelerated perception pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac ROS for real-time stereo depth estimation, visual SLAM (nvSLAM), and deep neural network inference. Students will learn to set up Isaac ROS packages, configure cameras in Isaac Sim, run perception algorithms achieving greater than 30 FPS and less than 50ms latency, and visualize results in RViz.

**Prerequisites**: Completion of Chapter 1 (Isaac Sim Setup), ROS 2 Humble installation, NVIDIA RTX GPU (minimum RTX 2060+)

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
