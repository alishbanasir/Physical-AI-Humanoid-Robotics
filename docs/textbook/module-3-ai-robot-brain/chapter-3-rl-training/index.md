# Chapter 3: Reinforcement Learning Training with Humanoid Models

## Overview

Chapter 3 introduces reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid control using massively parallel GPU simulation with Isaac Gym/Isaac Lab. Students will learn to set up RL environments, define observation/action spaces, design reward functions, train PPO policies achieving >70% success within 4 hours on RTX 3080, and deploy trained policies in Isaac Sim.

**Prerequisites**: Completion of Chapters 1-2, PyTorch basics, NVIDIA RTX GPU (minimum RTX 2060+, 8GB+ VRAM recommended)

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
