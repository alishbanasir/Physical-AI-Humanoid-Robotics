## Prompt

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

User invoked `/sp.tasks` command to generate actionable task list for Module 2 - Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity).

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive tasks.md with 291 tasks organized by 4 user stories (chapters):

**Task Organization**:
- **Phase 1: Setup** - 7 tasks (project initialization)
- **Phase 2: Foundational** - 8 tasks (BLOCKING shared resources: URDF, ROS 2 workspace)
- **Phase 3: User Story 1 / Chapter 1** - 53 tasks (Gazebo Physics Simulation - P1 Priority)
- **Phase 4: User Story 2 / Chapter 2** - 66 tasks (Unity Rendering & HRI - P2 Priority)
- **Phase 5: User Story 3 / Chapter 3** - 77 tasks (Sensor Simulation - P3 Priority)
- **Phase 6: User Story 4 / Chapter 4** - 65 tasks (Gazebo-Unity Integration - P4 Priority)
- **Phase 7: Finalization** - 15 tasks (cross-chapter polish, QA)

**Key Features**:
1. Each chapter is independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
2. 127 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution (44% parallelizable)
3. All tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] [TID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
4. Dependencies clearly mapped (Foundational blocks all chapters, Chapter 3 requires 1 & 2, Chapter 4 requires 1, 2, 3)
5. MVP scope defined: Phases 1-3 (68 tasks, ~2 weeks for Chapter 1 Gazebo Physics)

**Design Document Inputs Used**:
- spec.md: 4 user stories (P1-P4), functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-039), success criteria
- plan.md: Technology stack (Gazebo Classic 11, Unity 2022 LTS URP, ROS 2 Humble, stable-baselines3)
- data-model.md: Chapter structure, CodeExample format, asset types
- contracts/chapter-content-contract.md: Quality gates, validation rules, subagent handoff contracts
- research.md: Technology decisions (URP vs HDRP, ROS-TCP-Connector, SB3 for RL)

**Task Breakdown per Chapter**:

**Chapter 1 (Gazebo Physics)**:
- 5 examples (world creation, spawn humanoid, collision config, physics tuning, force application)
- 6 diagrams/screenshots
- 5 exercises (beginner to advanced)
- All examples validated in Docker with RTF ≥ 0.9 requirement

**Chapter 2 (Unity Rendering)**:
- 5 examples (Unity basics, URDF import, PBR materials, UI interaction, Timeline animations)
- 4 diagrams
- 4 exercises
- All projects tested in Unity 2022 LTS on Windows/Linux with FPS ≥ 30 requirement

**Chapter 3 (Sensor Simulation)**:
- 6 examples (Gazebo LiDAR, depth camera, IMU; Unity LiDAR, Perception package; sensor noise)
- 7 diagrams/screenshots
- 5 exercises
- Sensor data validation (LiDAR ≥10 Hz, depth ≥30 Hz, IMU ≥100 Hz)

**Chapter 4 (Integration)**:
- 3 examples (ROS 2 bridge setup, realtime sync, RL training workflow)
- 4 integration architecture diagrams
- 4 exercises
- Performance validation (latency <100ms, RL training 1000 steps)

**Execution Strategies Provided**:
1. MVP First: Setup → Foundational → Chapter 1 only (68 tasks, ~2 weeks)
2. Incremental Delivery: Add chapters sequentially (1→2→3→4)
3. Parallel Team: 4 specialized subagents (GazeboPhysicsAgent, UnityRenderingAgent, SensorSimulationAgent, IntegrationAgent)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 2 tasks.md generated with 291 actionable tasks across 4 chapters, organized by user story priority
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests (manual validation via Docker, Unity builds, quality gates per contract)
- 📁 Files: specs/002-module-2-digital-twin/tasks.md (created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to execute tasks with specialized subagents
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown aligns with Constitution Principle II (Modular Structure Integrity) - each chapter independently testable. 44% tasks parallelizable enables efficient team execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all design artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/) were complete and consistent
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Tasks follow checklist format ([TID] [P?] [Story?] Description), organized by user story, include exact file paths
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.tasks` workflow with design artifact inputs
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute `/sp.implement` to validate task executability with specialized subagents
