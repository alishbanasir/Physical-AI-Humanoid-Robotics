## Prompt

Create the implementation plan for the Module 2 Specification (Digital Twin Simulation). The plan must explicitly detail the use of specialized Claude Code Subagents (e.g., GazeboAgent, UnityAgent, PhysicsSimulationAgent) to generate the content for each of the four chapters (Gazebo Physics, Unity Rendering, Sensor Simulation, Integration Best Practices). Ensure the plan adheres to all Content Standards and Technical Accuracy Principles defined in the Constitution. The output format must target the Docusaurus framework already used in this project.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive Module 2 implementation plan with Phase 0 research and Phase 1 design artifacts.

**Branch**: 002-module-2-digital-twin
**Plan File**: specs/002-module-2-digital-twin/plan.md (947 lines)

**Implementation Approach**:
- **4 Specialized Subagents**: GazeboPhysicsAgent, UnityRenderingAgent, SensorSimulationAgent, IntegrationAgent
- **5-Phase Workflow**: Phase 0 (Research) → Phase 1 (Design) → Phase 2 (Implementation) → Phase 3 (Testing) → Phase 4 (Integration)
- **Quality Gates**: 20 gates per chapter (content quality, performance, platform-specific validation)

**Constitution Check Results**:
- ✅ Principle I (Technical Accuracy & Depth): PASS - Research-backed technology stack decisions
- ✅ Principle II (Modular Structure Integrity): PASS - 4-chapter structure strictly maintained
- ✅ Principle III (AI-Native Development): PASS - RL workflows integrated in Chapter 4

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive implementation plan created with 4 specialized subagents, complete research findings (6 questions), data model (11 entities), canonical content contract (24 quality gates), and development environment quickstart guide. Plan provides clear roadmap from research → design → implementation → testing → integration.
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution Check PASS (6/6 applicable principles). Research questions answered (6/6). Data model completeness validated (11 primary types). Contract validation rules defined (24 total gates). Quickstart validation script provided.
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md (947 lines), research.md (320 lines), data-model.md (580 lines), contracts/chapter-content-contract.md (510 lines), quickstart.md (450 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks` to generate actionable task list with subagent orchestration workflow, `/sp.implement` to execute tasks with specialized subagents, `/sp.adr` if architectural decisions need formal documentation
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan successfully balances technical rigor (research-backed decisions, performance gates, platform validation) with educational accessibility (stable-baselines3, URP, Gazebo Classic). Subagent orchestration workflow (5 phases, 20 gates per chapter) ensures systematic quality control. Shared asset contracts between subagents prevent duplication and maintain consistency across chapters.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Plan creation, research, and design artifacts completed successfully on first attempt.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check PASS (6/6 applicable principles). Research completeness PASS (6/6 questions answered with rationale). Data model completeness PASS (11 primary entity types defined). Contract validation PASS (24 quality gates defined with severity levels).
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan command with explicit requirement for specialized Claude Code Subagents and Docusaurus output format
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks to generate task list. Consider creating ADR for key architectural decisions (Gazebo Classic vs Fortress, URP vs HDRP, ROS-TCP-Connector vs ROS#) if formal documentation is needed. Monitor subagent handoff contracts (URDF sharing, ROS 2 package extension, Unity project template extension) during implementation phase.
