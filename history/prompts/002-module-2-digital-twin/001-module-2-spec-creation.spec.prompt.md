## Prompt

Create the Specification for the entire Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity).

The specification must ensure the generation of four distinct chapters based on the course outline:
1. Simulating Physics, Gravity, and Collisions in Gazebo.
2. High-fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity.
3. Simulating Sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs).
4. Gazebo and Unity Integration Best Practices for Physical AI.

The specification MUST adhere to all principles (Technical Accuracy, UI/UX Standards) and content standards defined in the project Constitution. The output format MUST be a single, comprehensive Spec file for the entire module.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive Module 2 specification with the following structure:

**Branch**: 002-module-2-digital-twin
**Spec File**: specs/002-module-2-digital-twin/spec.md

**Content Structure**:
- 4 User Stories (P1-P4) covering physics simulation, rendering, sensors, and integration
- 48 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-048) across 4 chapters plus cross-chapter requirements
- 12 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-012) covering performance, reliability, usability, compatibility, and security
- 22 Success Criteria (SC-001 to SC-022) across chapter completion, content quality, learning effectiveness, UX, and technical accuracy
- Comprehensive Assumptions, Out of Scope, Dependencies, Edge Cases, and Risk sections

**Key Features**:
1. **Chapter 1 - Gazebo Physics**: 9 FRs covering Gazebo architecture, physics engines (ODE/Bullet/DART), world configuration, collision dynamics, ROS 2 integration
2. **Chapter 2 - Unity Rendering**: 10 FRs covering Unity fundamentals, URDF import, PBR materials/lighting, human-robot interaction UI
3. **Chapter 3 - Sensor Simulation**: 9 FRs covering LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs in both Gazebo and Unity, noise modeling, ROS 2 integration
4. **Chapter 4 - Integration**: 11 FRs covering ROS 2 bridges, real-time sync, RL training workflows, cloud deployment, performance optimization

**Quality Validation**:
- Spec Quality Checklist: 16/16 items PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope clearly bounded with comprehensive out-of-scope section

**Technical Stack**:
- Gazebo Classic 11 or Gazebo Fortress/Garden
- Unity 2022 LTS
- ROS 2 Humble
- Python 3.10+ for sensor processing and RL training
- Optional: Docker, stable-baselines3, Gymnasium

**Dependencies**:
- Module 1 completion (ROS 2 Fundamentals, URDF modeling, package management)
- Sequential chapter dependencies: Physics → Rendering → Sensors → Integration
- Platform dependencies: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 for Gazebo, cross-platform Unity

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive 4-chapter Module 2 specification created, covering Digital Twin simulation from physics to integration. Provides foundation for planning phase.
- 🧪 Tests: Spec quality checklist validation (16/16 PASS). All requirements testable, success criteria measurable, scope clearly bounded.
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (320 lines) and checklists/requirements.md (73 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan, `/sp.clarify` if any ambiguities arise (none currently), `/sp.tasks` after planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances technical depth (physics engines, rendering pipelines, sensor models) with educational outcomes. Integration chapter (P4) appropriately builds on prior chapters, creating pedagogical progression.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Spec creation completed successfully on first attempt.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec Quality Checklist PASS (16/16 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify command with detailed 4-chapter outline
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan to generate implementation plan with subagent specifications for GazeboPhysicsAgent, UnityRenderingAgent, SensorSimulationAgent, IntegrationAgent
