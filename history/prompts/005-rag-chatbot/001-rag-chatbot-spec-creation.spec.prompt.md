## Prompt

```text
/sp.specify "RAG Chatbot Integration for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" "Develop and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot utilizing OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud. The chatbot must be able to answer questions based on the book's content and support text-selection querying."
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for RAG Chatbot Integration feature on branch `005-rag-chatbot`:

**Feature Overview:**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot embedded in Docusaurus textbook
- Enables students to ask questions about Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book content
- Supports text-selection querying for contextual clarification
- Maintains conversation history with follow-up question support

**Key Components Specified:**

1. **User Stories (4 prioritized)**:
   - P1: General Book Content Querying
   - P2: Text-Selection Context Querying
   - P3: Conversation History and Follow-up Questions
   - P1: Embedded UI Integration

2. **Functional Requirements**: 15 testable requirements covering:
   - Natural language query processing
   - Semantic search across all modules
   - Source citation for answers
   - Text-selection-based querying
   - Conversation context maintenance
   - UI embedding in Docusaurus
   - Content re-indexing automation

3. **Success Criteria**: 10 measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes:
   - 3-second response time for queries
   - 90% accuracy for factual questions
   - 95% accuracy in identifying out-of-scope topics
   - Support for 100 concurrent users
   - 80% student satisfaction rate

4. **Edge Cases**: 7 scenarios documented including non-English queries, API failures, malicious input, and concurrent user handling

5. **Clarification Resolved**: API usage budget set to ~1,000 queries/month with $50-100/month budget for pilot/prototype phase

**Validation Results:**
- All specification quality checklist items passed
- No implementation details in specification
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria properly technology-agnostic
- Feature ready for planning phase

## Outcome

-  Impact: Complete, validated specification ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- >ê Tests: Specification validation checklist - all items passed
- =Á Files: spec.md (212 lines), requirements.md checklist
- = Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create technical architecture and implementation plan
- >à Reflection: Comprehensive specification with clear user value, measurable outcomes, and well-defined scope. Two non-blocking open questions (content update frequency, user feedback mechanism) can be addressed during planning.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification completed successfully with user clarification
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All validation checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding more specific performance benchmarks during planning phase based on actual content volume
