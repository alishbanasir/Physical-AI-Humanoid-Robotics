## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for RAG Chatbot implementation organized by user stories:

**Task Organization**:
- Organized by 4 user stories from spec.md (P1, P2, P3 priorities)
- Each story is independently implementable and testable
- Clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified

**Task Structure**:
- **Phase 1**: Setup (8 tasks) - Project initialization
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (8 tasks) - Core infrastructure (blocking)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - General Querying (15 tasks) - P1 <¯ MVP
- **Phase 4**: User Story 4 - UI Integration (12 tasks) - P1 <¯ MVP
- **Phase 5**: User Story 2 - Text Selection (6 tasks) - P2
- **Phase 6**: User Story 3 - Conversation History (6 tasks) - P3
- **Phase 7**: Polish & Cross-Cutting (14 tasks)

**Total**: 69 tasks
- **MVP Scope**: 43 tasks (Phases 1-4)
- **Parallelizable**: 28 tasks marked with [P]

**Key Features**:
1. All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
2. Independent test criteria for each user story
3. Dependency graph showing completion order
4. Parallel execution groups identified
5. MVP clearly defined (US1 + US4 = core Q&A with UI)

**User Story Mapping**:
- **US1** (General Querying): Indexing pipeline + RAG services + API (15 tasks)
- **US4** (UI Integration): React components + Docusaurus plugin (12 tasks)
- **US2** (Text Selection): useTextSelection hook + context handling (6 tasks)
- **US3** (Conversation): History API + context window management (6 tasks)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- MVP-first approach: Complete US1 + US4 for working demo
- Backend and Frontend can develop in parallel after Phase 2
- Each user story delivers independently testable increment
- Critical path: Setup ’ Foundational ’ US1 ’ US4 ’ US2/US3 ’ Polish

## Outcome

-  Impact: Complete task list ready for `/sp.implement` execution
- >ê Tests: Independent test criteria defined for each user story
- =Á Files: tasks.md (369 lines) with 69 tasks
- = Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute tasks following dependency order
- >à Reflection: Task organization by user story enables parallel development and incremental delivery. MVP (43 tasks) provides working Q&A chatbot. All tasks have explicit file paths and success criteria.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow checklist format, all user stories mapped
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation from design documents
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider breaking T024 (main query endpoint) into smaller sub-tasks if it proves too complex during implementation
