## Prompt

User executed `/sp.plan` with the following instruction:

```
Create the implementation plan for the Module 4 Specification (Vision-Language-Action).
The plan must explicitly detail the use of specialized Claude Code Subagents (e.g., 'TechnicalContentAgent')
to generate the three distinct chapters.

CRITICALLY, the plan must adhere to the Token-Saving MVP Strategy:
it must ONLY schedule the creation of the primary index.md file for each chapter (Ch 1, Ch 2, Ch 3)
with minimal overview/placeholder content, and explicitly omit detailed sub-files, code generation tasks,
diagrams, and complex mathematical/chart generation elements.

The plan must ensure adherence to the Content Standards and Technical Accuracy Principles defined
in the Constitution, and consider the Docusaurus output format.
```

Followed by user message: "chapter 4 bhi create karein." (also create chapter 4)

Followed by user command: `/sp.tasks`

## Response snapshot

**Implementation Plan Created**: C:\Users\Rizwan Nasir\.claude\plans\compiled-forging-dusk.md

**Strategy**: Token-Saving MVP - Create ONLY minimal index.md files for each chapter with overview/placeholder content. Explicitly OMIT detailed sub-files, code generation, diagrams, and complex content.

**Executed Actions**:

1. **Created Directory Structure** (Phase 1):
   ```
   docs/textbook/module-4-vla/chapter-1-voice-to-action/
   docs/textbook/module-4-vla/chapter-2-cognitive-planning/
   docs/textbook/module-4-vla/chapter-3-capstone-project/
   docs/textbook/module-4-vla/chapter-4-advanced-deployment/
   ```

2. **Created Chapter 1 Index** (~450 tokens):
   - Title: "Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Pipeline with OpenAI Whisper"
   - 5 learning objectives (FR-001 to FR-012)
   - Prerequisites: Module 1 (ROS 2), Module 3 Chapter 1 (Isaac Sim)
   - Estimated time: 8-12 hours
   - 10 planned subsections in "Coming Soon" section
   - Validation criteria from SC-001, SC-002

3. **Created Chapter 2 Index** (~500 tokens):
   - Title: "Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs"
   - 6 learning objectives (FR-013 to FR-027)
   - Prerequisites: Chapter 1, Module 3 Chapters 2 & 4
   - Estimated time: 10-14 hours
   - 13 planned subsections in "Coming Soon" section
   - Validation criteria from SC-003, SC-004, SC-005

4. **Created Chapter 3 Index** (~550 tokens):
   - Title: "Chapter 3: Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid Robot"
   - 6 learning objectives (FR-028 to FR-046)
   - Prerequisites: Chapters 1-2, All Module 3
   - Estimated time: 20-30 hours
   - 17 planned subsections in "Coming Soon" section
   - Validation criteria from SC-006, SC-007, SC-008

5. **Created Chapter 4 Index** (~500 tokens, added per user request):
   - Title: "Chapter 4: Advanced VLA & Real-World Deployment"
   - 6 learning objectives covering sim-to-real transfer, safety systems, multi-robot coordination, VLA foundation models (RT-2, OpenVLA), RLHF, long-term autonomy
   - Prerequisites: Chapters 1-3, physical hardware access (optional)
   - Estimated time: 15-20 hours
   - 13 planned subsections in "Coming Soon" section
   - Topics: Sim-to-real transfer, real hardware deployment, multi-robot coordination, production deployment

6. **Updated Sidebar Navigation** (sidebars.js lines 96-120):
   - Added Module 4 category with 4 chapter doc entries
   - Type: 'doc' entries following Module 3 pattern
   - Labels: Chapter titles with concise names

7. **Created Tasks Breakdown** (specs/004-module-4-vla/tasks.md):
   - 66 tasks across 7 phases
   - Phase 1 (MVP): 8 tasks - ✅ COMPLETE
   - Phases 2-7: Future work (200,000 tokens, 134-181 hours)
   - Each task includes status, acceptance criteria, FR mapping, token estimates

**Key Decisions**:
- Initial plan had 3 chapters; user requested 4th chapter ("chapter 4 bhi create karein")
- Chapter 4 focuses on advanced topics: sim-to-real, multi-robot, foundation models, production deployment
- All chapters follow "Coming Soon" pattern from Module 3 Chapters 2/3/4
- No detailed subsections, code examples, or diagrams created (deferred to Phases 2-5)

**Validation**:
- ✅ Docusaurus compiled successfully (no MDX errors)
- ✅ All 4 chapters visible in sidebar navigation
- ✅ All internal links resolve correctly
- ✅ Total MVP token count: ~2,000 tokens (vs ~200,000 for full implementation)
- ✅ Constitution compliance: Technical accuracy, modular structure, SDD methodology

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 4 foundational structure established with 4 minimal chapter landing pages, enabling future detailed content implementation without token waste. Sidebar navigation complete, Docusaurus compilation successful.
- 🧪 Tests: Docusaurus webpack compilation successful, sidebar rendering verified, internal link resolution confirmed, token budget validated (~2,000 tokens used vs 200,000 deferred)
- 📁 Files: Created 4 chapter index.md files (1,800 tokens), updated sidebars.js (100 tokens), created tasks.md (comprehensive task breakdown)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Phase 2 detailed content implementation starting with Task 2.1 (Chapter 1.1 Speech Recognition Fundamentals), or continue with other module priorities
- 🧠 Reflection: Token-Saving MVP strategy successfully balanced immediate structural requirements with long-term content development efficiency. User's request for Chapter 4 was appropriately handled by extending the pattern rather than rejecting scope change.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Initial plan had 3 chapters, but user feedback led to 4-chapter structure which better aligns with other modules. MDX compilation succeeded without `<N` pattern errors (those were fixed in earlier session on module landing page).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Constitution compliance: PASS (technical accuracy, modular structure, SDD methodology)
  - Docusaurus compilation: PASS (no MDX errors)
  - Sidebar navigation: PASS (all chapters visible and navigable)
  - Token budget: PASS (~2,000 tokens vs 200,000 budgeted)
  - Content standards: PASS (learning objectives measurable, prerequisites stated, validation criteria included)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.plan` followed by `/sp.tasks`, with user-initiated scope change ("chapter 4 bhi create karein")
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 2 implementation with Task 2.1 (create 1.1 Speech Recognition Fundamentals subsection) to validate detailed content generation workflow, or create PHR first (current task)
